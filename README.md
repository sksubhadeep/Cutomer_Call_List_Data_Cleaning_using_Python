# Data_Cleaning_using_Python

A journey through the transformation of messy data into actionable insights was embarked upon through the data cleaning process in python, where:

1️⃣ **Duplicate Rows Eliminated**: Duplicate rows from the Customer Call List DataFrame were eliminated, ensuring data accuracy.

2️⃣ **Bid Farewell to 'Not_Useful_Column'**: The 'Not_Useful_Column' that was cluttering the dataset was bid farewell to,thus streamlining the data.

3️⃣ **'Last_Name' Given a Polish**: The 'Last_Name' column was cleaned, making it more consistent and user-friendly.

4️⃣ **Phone Numbers Reformatted**: Phone numbers were reformatted into a consistent and correct format by the Python script.

5️⃣ **Address Splitting Undertaken**: The address was split into 'Street_Address,' 'State,' and 'Zipcode' columns for improved data structure.

6️⃣ **Boolean Values Standardized**: Boolean columns were standardized , making them easier to work with for analysis.

7️⃣ **Customer Data Filtered**: Data for customers who either didn't provide phone numbers or indicated that they didn't want to be contacted was removed, respecting their preferences.

8️⃣ **Index Reset**: The DataFrame's index was reset, resulting in a cleaner and more organized presentation of the data.

9️⃣ **Data Preserved**: Finally, the cleaned data was saved to a directory, ensuring it's readily available for analysis and future use.

Data cleaning isn't just about tidying up data; it's about ensuring the quality and integrity of our information, which in turn empowers us to make data-driven decisions confidently.
